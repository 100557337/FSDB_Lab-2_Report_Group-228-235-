    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. BookEditions := π(title, author, language) (books ⋈ editions)\n",
    "2. LanguageCount := γ(title, author); COUNT(DISTINCT language)→lang_count (BookEditions)\n",

    "5. BoreBooks := QualifiedBooks - LoanedBooks\n",

    "##### **Key operators:**\n",
    "- **⋈** : Natural join (combines tables by matching column names)\n",
    "- **π** : Projection (selects specific columns)\n",
    "- **γ** : Group-by aggregation\n",
    "- **σ** : Selection (filters rows)\n",
    "- **-** : Set difference (finds records in first set but not second)\n",

    "##### **How it works**:\n",
    "1. First joins books with their editions\n",
    "2. Groups by book + author to count distinct languages\n",

    "6. FinalReport := DriverInfo ⋈ Seniority ⋈ ActiveYears ⋈ StopsPerDriver ⋈ LoansPerDriver\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### \\*\\*Key steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **DriverInfo**: Gets driver's personal data\n",
    "2. **Seniority**: Calculates contracted years (FLOOR rounds down)\n",
    "3. **ActiveYears**: Counts distinct years with assignments\n",
    "4. **StopsPerDriver**: Counts all stops made by each driver\n",
    "5. **LoansPerDriver**: Calculates:\n",
    "   - Total loans handled\n",
    "   - Count of unreturned loans (where return IS NULL)\n",
    "6. **FinalReport**: Joins all metrics together\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Why it works**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each γ (gamma) operation groups by passport and calculates one metric\n",
    "- The final join combines all metrics for the complete report\n",
    "- Handles edge cases (like division by zero) through SQL implementation\n",
    "- Matches your output showing drivers with their:\n",

    "  - Stops/Year (total_stops/active_years)\n",
    "  - % Unreturned (unreturned/total_loans)\n",

    "This explains why see values like the following are shown:\n",
    "\n",

    "### D. **Add a column ‘reads’ to Books. When a book is loaned, update the number of reads.**\n",
    "- Design:\n",
    "    - We add a new column reads to the books table, which tracks how many times a book has been loaned. The trg_update_book_reads trigger automatically increments this counter whenever a new loan record (type = ‘L’) is inserted into the loans table.\n",
    "    - New Column:\n",
    "        - ```sql ALTER TABLE books ADD (reads NUMBER DEFAULT 0); ```\n",
    "        - This adds a numeric column reads to books. Any existing rows start with reads = 0.\n",
    "    - Logic:\n",
    "        - The trigger fires AFTER INSERT on loans.\n",
    "        - It checks whether the new row is a loan (type = ‘L’) rather than a reservation (type = ‘R’).\n",
    "        - If so, it finds the isbn from copies (using the signature), then retrieves the corresponding title and author from editions.\n",

    "# Concluding Remarks\n",
    "\n",
    "- The queries and triggers worked well and covered real-life use cases like managing loans, reservations, and tracking book reads.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The results matched expectations during testing, and the logic handled edge cases smoothly (like banned users or unavailable copies).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Creating the views and packages made the system feel more user-friendly and organized.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We spent around 18–20 hours overall—learning a lot about relational algebra, SQL joins, grouping, and PL/SQL triggers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For future labs, a visual schema and sample data would help a lot. Splitting the work into smaller parts could also make things easier.\n",
